wCat is a clone of cat command available in bash but not in windows cmd.

It is used to display or make a copy content of one or more files in the terminal 

General Syntax:
wcat [options] [files]


option to remove big line break (-s)
option to add line number to non empty lines (-b)
option to add line numbers to all lines (-n) 

Commands:

1- wcat filename => displays content of the file in the terminal 
2- wcat filename1 filename2 filename3... => displays content of all files in the terminal(contactinated form) in the given order.
3- wcat -s filename => convert big line breaks into a singular file 
4- wcat -n filename => give numbering to all the lines 
5- wcat -b filename => give numbering to non-empty lines 
6- wcat filename > filename2 => put all the content of filename into filename2 by overriding also creates filename2 if it doesn't exist.
7- wcat filename >> filename2 => append all the content of filename into filename2
8- wcat -s filename > filename2 =>get the file content of filename remove large spaces and save the output in filename2


We can mix and match the options.


Edge cases:
1- If file entered is not found then it gives file does not exist error.
2- -n and -b are 2 options which are mutually exclusive so if user types both of them together only the first enter option should work.
